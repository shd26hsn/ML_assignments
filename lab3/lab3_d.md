I chose the *Superstore dataset* because it has clear and organized information that is easy to analyze.
It includes sales, profit, dates and product details, so I was able to apply the EDA steps we learned in class.
I checked the data types, cleaned the dates and numbers, looked for missing values and duplicates
and then made different visualizations to understand the sales trends and relationships in the dataset.
